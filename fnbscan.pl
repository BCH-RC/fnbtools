	$0
	REQUIRED -n the project name
	REQUIRED -m the mutant bedg file(only one pooled sample allowed)
	REQUIRED -o output file name containing identified deletions

	OPTIONS:
	-c the control bedg file(s),used to filter out homo and heter deletion
	-x the contorl bedg file(s),used to filter out homo deletions
	-g input annotation file to annotate deletions     
	-h print this help message
	-a print all homo deletions in mutant including the deletions exist in control sample [0|1, default:0]
	-r the overlapping rate between gaps and informative deletion at the same genomic regions [default:0.9]
	-d the minimal distance between the breakpoint of informative reads and the start postion of gap [default:20]
	-b the minimal crossed reads when there is no clipped reads [default:3]
	-s the minimal small deletion reads [default:2]
	-f the minimal flanking reads up and downstream of deletions [default:1]
